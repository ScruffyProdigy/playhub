# JoinQuest

**Build the game. We handle the lobby.**

JoinQuest is a gaming platform for web developers who want to ship a multiplayer title without spending months on accounts, matchmaking, storefronts, and payments first. Players discover games here, queue up, and get sent to **your** game on **your** URL with a signed seat assignment. You keep your own site and codebase; we provide the plumbing — and aim to do it better than a solo dev would have time to.

→ **[Product vision](docs/vision.md)** — why this exists, who it’s for, how integration fits together.

## For game developers

| You build | JoinQuest provides |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Game logic, UI, servers on your domain | Sign-in, catalog, queues, matchmaking (LFG) |
| Seat manifest (`seatTemplate`) | Seat map assignment + provision push + JWT `seatKey` |
| Accept or reject rosters | Player traffic and (roadmap) shop / entitlements |

**Making a game?** Register and integrate on your timeline — public listing is reviewed when you're ready. See [developer self-service](docs/developer-self-service.md).

Reference game: `demo-game-rps` (sibling repo / deploy scripts in this project).

## For players (today)

Browse the catalog, sign in, join mode queues, and launch into registered third-party games when a match is ready.

## Architecture

This project consists of:

- **Backend**: Go-based GraphQL API with gqlgen
- **Frontend**: React + Vite application (JoinQuest player shell)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection management

See [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md) and [Vision](docs/vision.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (optional)

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scruffyprodigy/playhub.git
cd playhub
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/dev.sh
```

### Manual Setup

See [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Backend only
./scripts/test-backend.sh

# Frontend only
./scripts/test-frontend.sh

# With E2E tests
./scripts/test-frontend.sh --e2e
```

### Development Servers

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
./scripts/dev.sh
```

### Code Generation

The backend uses gqlgen for GraphQL code generation:

```bash
cd backend
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen@v0.17.81 generate
```

### Database Migrations

The project includes a complete database migration system:

```bash
cd backend

# Run all pending migrations
make migrate-up

# Check migration status
make migrate-version

# Rollback last migration
make migrate-down
```

See [Database Migrations](docs/database-migrations.md) for detailed documentation.

### Deployment

Deploy to different environments:

```bash
# Local development (minikube)
./deploy-local.sh

# Staging environment
./deploy-staging.sh

# Production environment
./deploy-production.sh
```

See [Environment Configuration](docs/environment-configuration.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
