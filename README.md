## Architecture

This project consists of:

- **Backend**: Go-based GraphQL API with gqlgen
- **Frontend**: React + Vite application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (optional)

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scruffyprodigy/playhub.git
cd playhub
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/dev.sh
```

### Manual Setup

See [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Backend only
./scripts/test-backend.sh

# Frontend only
./scripts/test-frontend.sh

# With E2E tests
./scripts/test-frontend.sh --e2e
```

### Development Servers

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
./scripts/dev.sh
```

### Code Generation

The backend uses gqlgen for GraphQL code generation:

```bash
cd backend
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen@v0.17.81 generate
```

### Deployment

Deploy to different environments:

```bash
# Local development (minikube)
./deploy-local.sh

# Staging environment
./deploy-staging.sh

# Production environment
./deploy-production.sh
```
