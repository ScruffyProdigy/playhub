# Player return routing

Games send players to a **stable return hub** after a match. Lobby resolves **where each player goes next** from context stored at match time.

**Related:** [lobby-protocol-handoff.md](./lobby-protocol-handoff.md) · [match-lifecycle-callbacks.md](./match-lifecycle-callbacks.md)

## Contract (games)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| `lobby.returnUrl` on provision | `{LOBBY_PUBLIC_URL}/return` (e.g. `https://joinquest.cc/return`) |
| Player exit link | `{returnUrl}?match={externalMatchId}` |

Games store `returnUrl` from provision once per match. When a player leaves, link them to the URL above. Lobby’s `/return` page loads signed-in, reads `returnDestination(matchId)`, and redirects.

**Do not** embed per-player paths in the game — Lobby owns routing.

---

## Return context (Lobby DB)

When a player is seated for a match, Lobby stores JSON on `game_session_participants.return_context`:

```json
{
  "kind": "catalog_lfg",
  "path": "/",
  "gameId": "…",
  "modeQueueId": "…"
}
```

| `kind` | Meaning | Typical `path` |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `catalog_lfg` | Joined via catalog queue | `/` (home / catalog) |
| `room` | Room after table start | `/room/{inviteCode}` |

Room/table spec: [rooms-and-tables.md](./rooms-and-tables.md).

New entry paths set context at join/match time. The return hub only reads it.

---

## GraphQL

**Player (session cookie):**

```graphql
query ReturnDestination($matchId: ID) {
  returnDestination(matchId: $matchId) {
    path
    kind
  }
}
```

**Game server (Bearer `serviceToken` from provision):** see [match-lifecycle-callbacks.md](./match-lifecycle-callbacks.md).

---

## Environment

| Variable | Role |
|----------|------|
| `LOBBY_PUBLIC_URL` | Browser origin (e.g. `https://joinquest.cc`) |
| `LOBBY_RETURN_URL` | Optional full return hub URL override (must include `/return` path if set) |

If unset, return hub = `LOBBY_PUBLIC_URL` + `/return`.

---

## Building the player exit link

Games receive `lobby.returnUrl` (the hub base) on provision. Append the Lobby session id (`externalMatchId`) when linking players back:

```
{returnUrl}?match={externalMatchId}
```

**Reference implementations** (keep in sync):

| Language | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Go | `backend/internal/returnlink.AppendMatchID` (also `auth.LobbyReturnURLForMatch`) |
| TypeScript | `demo-game-rps/client/src/lobbyReturn.ts` → `buildLobbyReturnLink` |

The JoinQuest frontend does not build this link — only games do. The `/return` hub resolves routing via `returnDestination`.

---

## Implementation status

- Return hub route: `/return` (frontend)
- `returnDestination` query
- `return_context` on session participants (`catalog_lfg` at match create)
- `reportPlayerFinished` / `reportMatchResult` mutations
