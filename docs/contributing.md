# Contributing to JoinQuest

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JoinQuest!

We are building infrastructure so indie web developers can **ship multiplayer games** without getting stuck on lobby, auth, and commerce first. If that mission resonates, you are in the right place. Background: **[Product vision](vision.md)**.

**AI agents / maintainers:** start with **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** and **[lobby-maintenance.md](lobby-maintenance.md)** before exploring the codebase.

> **Naming:** product = **JoinQuest** (`joinquest.cc`). GitHub repo = [`scruffyprodigy/playhub`](https://github.com/scruffyprodigy/playhub). Local folder is often `lobby`. Legacy `playhub` names remain in Docker images and database names.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub (or work on a branch if you have write access)
2. **Clone** locally
3. **Set up** with `./scripts/setup.sh`
4. **Create a feature branch** for your changes
5. **Make your changes** and test them
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Quick Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scruffyprodigy/playhub.git
cd playhub   # folder may be named lobby locally
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup
See [Development Guide](development.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style in the surrounding files
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- After editing `docs/developer-agent-playbook.md` or `docs/developer-integration-guide.md`, run `./scripts/sync-developer-docs.sh`
- After GraphQL schema changes, run `cd backend && make generate`

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Pre-ship checks (recommended)
./scripts/ship-joinquest.sh --check

# Or run individually
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/test-backend.sh
./scripts/test-frontend.sh --e2e
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add short description of why"
```

Use clear commit messages focused on the *why* (see recent history on `main`).

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Code Style

### Backend (Go)
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `go vet` for static analysis
- Write tests for all public functions

### Frontend (JavaScript/React)
- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Follow React best practices
- Write tests for components (Vitest)
- Frontend uses JSX (not TypeScript)

### Developer dashboard / MCP changes
When changing developer-facing GraphQL operations, update backend, frontend, MCP, and docs together — see the checklist in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

### General
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the existing project structure

## Testing

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for all resolvers
- Test error conditions
- Include benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Ensure drift detection tests pass

### Frontend Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Test user interactions
- Include integration tests for user journeys
- Run E2E tests for critical paths

### Test Coverage
- Focus on critical business logic and integration paths
- Don't test implementation details
