## 0. Discover your game (agents + developers)

Before writing API code or catalog copy, make sure you (or your agent) understand what you're building. Start open-ended, listen, then ask clarifying questions only for what's still unclear. Draft metadata and manifest suggestions for developer approval.

### Start open-ended

Invite the developer to describe the game in their own words — no checklist yet:

> Tell me about the game you're thinking of — as much or as little as you have. What's the idea, how do people play together, who it's for, anything you're excited about or unsure about.

### Clarify only what's missing

Read their description and identify gaps. Ask follow-ups conversationally — one or two at a time. If they already answered something, do not re-ask it.

**Confirm what you think you know:** If you can infer an answer but aren't fully sure, check it with the developer instead of guessing or asking from scratch. For example: "It sounds like this is mostly a 2-player game — would you say that's fair?"

| Topic | Why it matters | Only ask if unclear |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Player count | seatTemplate / game-modes | min/max, fixed or variable |
| Structure | seatTemplate | duel, free-for-all, teams, or roles |
| Social mode | tags + tone | competitive, cooperative, or party |
| Session length | tags + copy | quick rounds vs longer sessions |
| Vibe / audience | catalog voice | casual, brainy, chaotic, tactical, etc. |
| API URL | registration | public HTTPS hosting plan (not localhost) |

### From answers → manifest + tags

| If the game is… | Start with | Example tags |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 1v1 competitive | `{ "count": 2 }` duel mode | `competitive`, `1v1`, `quick` |
| Team vs team | `Team: { count: 2, Seat: { count: N } }` | `competitive`, `party` |
| Co-op in one group | `{ "count": N }` or single team template | `cooperative`, `party` |
| Roles / composition | Role buckets in `seatTemplate` | `competitive` or `cooperative` + role-specific copy |

See the [seat template cookbook](./seat-templates-and-matchmaking.md#cookbook) for JSON examples.

Agents: after discovery, call `updateMyGameMetadata` with drafted copy (developer confirms) and implement the suggested `seatTemplate` on the game API.

## 1. Catalog voice (JoinQuest tone)

Lobby copy is **warm, plain, and player-first** — not enterprise, not hype.

**Do**

- Use short sentences. Card blurbs ~120 characters.
- Say “look for a group” / “play together”, not “enter matchmaking queue”.
- Describe what players *do*, not tech stack.
- Match the friendly tone of JoinQuest: *“Find your group. Play together.”*

**Don't**

- Stack buzzwords (“next-gen social competitive ecosystem”).
- Mention JWT, GraphQL, or provision in player-facing copy.
- Use ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation marks.

**Examples**

| Weak | Better (short description) |
|------|------------------------------|
| “Real-time multiplayer word game leveraging WebSocket architecture” | “Race friends to find words on a shared grid.” |
| “The ultimate 1v1 RPS experience!!!” | “Classic rock paper scissors — best of three, no accounts on your side.” |

**Field guide**

| Field | Audience | Length / notes |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `shortDescription` | Catalog card | 1–2 sentences, ~120 chars |
| `longDescription` | Detail page | 2–4 short paragraphs; what it is, why it's fun |
| `howToPlay` | Detail page | 3–6 bullet steps; first-time player |
| `tags` | Catalog chips | 1–3 from [taxonomy](#catalog-tag-taxonomy); max 3 shown in UI |

---

## 2. Catalog tag taxonomy

Use **only** these tag IDs (labels shown in UI):

| ID | Label | Use when |
|----|-------|----------|
| `competitive` | Competitive | Winners/losers, rankings, direct opposition |
| `cooperative` | Co-op | Players win or lose together |
| `party` | Party | Social, groups, casual fun |
| `1v1` | 1v1 | Exactly two players head-to-head |
| `quick` | Quick | Sessions under ~10 minutes |
| `words` | Words | Word/language puzzles |
| `strategy` | Strategy | Planning, hidden info, tactics |
| `casual` | Casual | Low pressure, easy to pick up |

Query `catalogTagTaxonomy` for the machine-readable list.

---

## 3. Quick start (API)

1. **Health** — `GET {apiBaseUrl}/healthz` → `ok`
2. **Status** — `GET {apiBaseUrl}/api/v1/status` → `{ game, version, launchUrlsOnProvision: true }`
3. **Game modes** — `GET {apiBaseUrl}/api/v1/game-modes` → modes with valid `seatTemplate`

Register at [/developers](/developers). Lobby syncs your manifest on connect.

---

## 4. Seat manifest (`seatTemplate`)

Each mode needs `minPlayers`, `maxPlayers`, and a `seatTemplate` Lobby expands into join buckets. Games receive a **final seat map** — you don't run matchmaking.

Flat `seats[]` arrays are **rejected**. Use `count` or nested `Team` / role nodes.

Full reference: [seat-templates-and-matchmaking.md](./seat-templates-and-matchmaking.md).

---

## 5. Provision contract

`POST {apiBaseUrl}/api/v1/matches`

- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {serviceToken}` from dashboard (or provision body `lobby.serviceToken`)
- **Idempotent** on `assignment.externalMatchId`
- **Success:** `200/201` with `launchUrls` map (lobbyUserId → URL base, no JWT) or `launchUrlTemplate`
- **Banned roster:** `403` with `{ "error": "...", "bannedLobbyUserIds": ["..."] }`

### Troubleshooting

<a id="provision-403-banned"></a>

**`provision.banlist` fail** — Return 403 with a `bannedLobbyUserIds` string array. To verify, temporarily ban test user `a0000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000099` during checklist runs.

<a id="provision-auth"></a>

**`provision.auth` fail** — Accept the dashboard `serviceToken` on the `Authorization` header.

<a id="provision-launch-urls"></a>

**`provision.launch_urls` fail** — Every seated player in the assignment needs a `launchUrls` entry (or a usable `launchUrlTemplate`).

---

## 6. JWT + claim

Lobby mints seat JWTs (`iss`, `aud` = your API base URL, `matchId`, `seatKey`, `sub` = lobby user id).

- Publish JWKS at `{lobbyIssuer}/.well-known/jwks.json`
- **Claim:** `POST {apiBaseUrl}/api/v1/matches/{externalMatchId}/claim` with `Authorization: Bearer {jwt}`
- Reject wrong `aud`, wrong `iss`, expired tokens, wrong reserved `seatKey`, unknown or mismatched match (`404`), malformed token (`401`/`403`)

---

## 7. Launch URLs (game-minted)

Required. Lobby attaches `token=<jwt>` to each URL base you return. See [game-minted-launch-urls.md](./game-minted-launch-urls.md).

**Do not** embed a JWT in `launchUrls` or `launchUrlTemplate` — JoinQuest adds `token=` when linking players.

---

## 8. Recommended local tests (game repo)

JoinQuest runs remote checks via the developer dashboard or MCP `joinquest_integration_run_game_checks`. **Also add fast unit/integration tests in your game repo** so agents and CI catch regressions before deploy.

Use the reference game [`demo-game-rps`](https://github.com/scruffyprodigy/demo-game-rps) (sibling repo) as a template. Suggested coverage:

| Area | What to test | Reference (RPSLR) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Manifest** | `launchUrlsOnProvision: true`; valid `seatTemplate`; expanded `seatKey` list | `app.test.ts`, `gameModes.test.ts` |
| **Provision** | Happy path + `launchUrls` per seat; idempotent re-push; reject missing/invalid `Authorization` | `app.test.ts`, `provision.test.ts` |
| **Launch URLs** | Per-player URLs; no `token=` in bases | `launchUrls.test.ts` |
| **JWT claim** | Valid token; wrong `aud`/`iss`; expired; malformed; URL `:ref` ≠ token `matchId`; wrong reserved seat | `app.test.ts`, `jwksRotation.test.ts` |
| **JWKS rotation** | Verify tokens signed with either key while both are in JWKS; reject retired key | `jwksRotation.test.ts` |
| **Banlist** | `403` + `bannedLobbyUserIds` when roster includes banned user | `app.test.ts` |
| **Lifecycle** | `reportMatchResult` GraphQL call; return URL builder | `lobbyClient.test.ts`, `lobbyReturn.test.ts` |
| **Realtime** | WS subscribe receives state after REST mutation | `ws.test.ts` |

Agents: after implementing endpoints, add or extend tests mirroring these rows, then run `npm test` in the game API before asking the developer to run JoinQuest checks.

## 9. Testing with friends

When integration checks pass:

1. Open your developer dashboard → **Create test table**
2. Invite friends via your room link
3. They can play while the game stays off the public catalog

---

## 10. Public release

When integration checks are green and catalog metadata is complete (`shortDescription`, `longDescription`, at least one tag):

1. Dashboard → **Request public release**
2. JoinQuest reviews (spam/IP/offensive names)
3. Approved games appear in the main catalog
